    ##### SCENARIO #####
You decide to go upstairs, so you start silently stepping the wooden staircase
until you reach the first floor. There's something on your body telling you that
something is off... Then, you heard a scream of help "HELP, HE'S GOING TO COOM
SOON, HELP ME!", in the room next to you! It sounds just like the record of that
one boy that was missing! It's him! You can take him out before the kidnapper
comes back.
