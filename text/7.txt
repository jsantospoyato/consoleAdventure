    ##### SCENARIO #####
You decided to leave. The feeling you just received, the second time, it was way
too much, and there was something off about that scream of help, as if it was not
human... When you are outside the house, you decided to watch, there was
definitely a window outside connected to that room, you can still hear quiet
"HELP ME" screams on the distance, you focus your vision on some point of that
room, and get to see a monstrous identity with a jaw covered in sharp teeth...
IT IS THE THING THAT WAS MAKING THOSE SCREAMS OF HELP, IMITATING HUMAN VOICE
<<WHAT IS THAT?>> People is going to think you are crazy, but are you?

    ----- ENDING -----
When you tell your mates in such a self-believing way, they decide to send you
to a psychiatrist. You are not crazy, you saw it... Maybe...

END(4/4) - Trust your guts!
Do you want to keep playing ('-1' to leave, '0' to restart):
